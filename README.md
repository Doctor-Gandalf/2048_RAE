# 2048 Rogue-Agile Edition

This is a clone of Gabriele Cirulli's game 2048 (https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), playable in terminal.
This game runs on the Agile Engine, and acts as an easy-access demo of what the engine is capable of.


For graphics, it relies upon the Curses library, which limits it to running on Linux and OSX.
